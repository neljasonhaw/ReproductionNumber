knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load packages in the library
First, we load the following packages in our library: `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `R0`, and `writexl`

```{r library, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)      # General data analysis package
library(janitor)        # General data cleaning package
library(R0)             # Reproduction number
library(writexl)        # Export to Excel spreadsheet
```

## Working directory
Ideally, we should also be setting a working directory. This working directory will contain all the input and output files used by the analysis so that we do not have to keep referencing the entire directory every time we need to import or export files.
